      <h2>Welcome to FedTrain (Former Site)</h2>
      <p>For over three decades FedTrain provided tailored financial management and appropriations law training to scores of federal agencies and tens of thousands of federal executives, managers and administrators.</p>
      <p>In December 2022 FedTrain ceased to do business and closed its doors.  It has been a amazing experience for us and we are forever grateful to the organizations that chose us to conduct this important training for them.</p>
      <p>If you have contacted us in search of a <strong><em>replacement training certificate</em></strong>, no worries.&nbsp; We have copies of certificates issued after January 1, 1999.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Allow 10-14 working days for us to get it to you.</p>

      <p>Best wishes to you in all your future endeavors.</p>
