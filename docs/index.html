        <h1 class="site-title">Welcome to FedTrain (Former Site)</h1>
        <p>For over three decades FedTrain provided tailored financial management and appropriations law training to scores of federal agencies and tens of thousands of federal executives, managers and administrators.</p>
        <p>In December 2022 FedTrain ceased to do business and closed its doors.  It has been a amazing experience for us and we are forever grateful to the organizations that chose us to conduct this important training for them.</p>
        <p>If you have contacted us in search of a <strong><em>replacement training certificate</em></strong>, no worries.&nbsp; We have copies of certificates issued after January 1, 1999.</p>
